README

Transforms the output of Ripper.sexp into simple XML via Nokogiri, giving you access to the whole XML toolchain, including CSS selectors, XPath, XSLT, and XQuery.

Ylyn is still in early alpha, as in I just got the first draft sorta working on a limited set of sample code earlier tonight. See TODO.

$ bundle exec pry -r './ylyn.rb'

> puts Ylyn.new('class Foo ; end').css('const_ref').to_xml

<const_ref>
  <_const value="Foo" location="1 6"/>
</const_ref>
