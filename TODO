TODO:

- figure out why we're losing indentation on to_xml - looks related to text nodes
- '.' and 'or' showing up as text nodes: approprate?
- decide what we want text nodes for, if at all

- test, test, test
  - write test cases for every language construct
  - put them all together

- transform XML back into Ruby
